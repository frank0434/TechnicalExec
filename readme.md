# Aim:
A client, Big Mart, is trying to optimise their supply chain. To do so Big Mart needs to understand and forecast sales of each product. Can you help Big Mart with this using the available data? 

# The data:
The Big Mart dataset (attached) consists of 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. It consists of 12 features: Item_Identifier ( is a unique product ID assigned to every distinct item), Item_Weight (includes the weight of the product), Item_Fat_Content (describes whether the product is low fat or not), Item_Visibility (mentions the percentage of the total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product), Item_Type (describes the food category to which the item belongs), Item_MRP (Maximum Retail Price (list price of the product), Outlet_Identifier (unique store ID assigned. It consists of an alphanumeric string of length 6), Outlet_Establishment_Year (mentions the year in which store was established), Outlet_Size (tells the size of the store in terms of ground area covered), Outlet_Location_Type (tells about the size of the city in which the store is located), Outlet_Type (tells whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket) and Item_Outlet_Sales ( sales of the product in the particular store).


# Goals:
-	Build a model to predict the number of sales (Item_Outlet_Sales) using the available features.
-	Gain insights about the number of sales.

# Tools and presentation:

-	You can use R or Python
-	Presentation will be 15 minutes + discussion afterwards. 
-	Pretend you are presenting the results to an executive level manager of one of our clients.
-	Feel free to present the results in whatever format you deem most appropriate. 
-	Please send your r/python code through in a separate file before the presentation.
